# Deep Learning Practice Dump

This repository is my active experimentation space for deep learning and machine learning models.

It is intentionally unpolished.

The goal is rapid iteration, architecture testing, debugging, and understanding model behavior — not production deployment.

---

## What This Repo Is

- A sandbox for testing model ideas
- A place to break things and fix them
- A space to compare architectures
- A log of learning progression
- A collection of experiments on real datasets

---

## What This Repo Is Not

- A polished portfolio project
- A production-ready system
- A final optimized implementation
- A research paper

This is raw practice.

---

## Current Focus Areas

- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Loss behavior experimentation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Overfitting diagnostics
- Feature scaling impact
- Optimizer comparisons
- Dataset behavior analysis

---

## Datasets Used

This folder may include:

- Classic ML benchmark datasets
- Public R datasets
- Kaggle datasets
- Custom structured datasets

Large datasets may not be uploaded directly.  
Instructions or references will be provided instead.

## Typical Workflow

For most experiments:

1. Load dataset
2. Clean / preprocess
3. Apply encoding / scaling
4. Build model architecture
5. Train
6. Evaluate
7. Analyze errors
8. Modify architecture
9. Repeat

Iteration is the objective.

## Structure

Folders may look like:

```
experiment_name/
    ├── dataset/
    ├── notebook.ipynb
    ├── model.py
    ├── train.py
    └── results.txt
```

Not every experiment will be perfectly structured.

That is intentional.

---

## Why Keep This Public?

Because growth should be visible.

This repository reflects:
- Learning curve
- Experiment history
- Model evolution
- Mistakes and corrections

---

## Disclaimer

Expect:
- Inconsistent structure
- Half-finished experiments
- Rapid prototypes
- Code refactoring over time

This is a living practice environment.
